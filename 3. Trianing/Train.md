**The Basics of Secure Software Design, Development, and Testing**

The Basics of Secure Software Design, Development, and Testing .This class introduces all engineers to the basics of security.



**Fuzz Testing in Depth**

Explained  **Secure Testing Policies.**  this class is an effective way to find certain classes of security bugs. This class explains how fuzz testing works, how to build effective fuzz tests, and how to identify
fuzz-testing failures.



**Threat Modeling in Depth** 

threat modeling is a method for uncovering design flaws in a software component before the component is
built. This class, which includes a small exercise at the end, outlines the process.



**Implementing Threat Mitigations** 

This class begins where the threat-modeling class
leaves off. The original threat-modeling class covered the threat-modeling process as
well as development tasks and test tasks. This turned out to be a great deal of content,
spanning many disciplines, and was simply too unwieldy. The present threat-modeling
class covers just the threat-modeling process, and the “Implementing Threat Mitigations”
class is aimed mainly at developers and helps them to decide how to choose the
appropriate mitigations or countermeasures.



**Security Design and Architecture**

Time-Tested Design Principles We touch on this subject
in Chapter 7, “Stage 2: Define and Follow Design Best Practices.” Most software
developers focus solely on best practice to lift themselves out of the security pit, but we
need to go much further than simple best practice. Engineers should learn some of the
basic security models, such as the Bell-LaPadula Disclosure model (Wikipedia 2006a)
and the Biba integrity model (Wikipedia 2006b), and secure design principles such as
Saltzer and Schroeder (Saltzer and Schroeder 1975).



**Introduction to the SDL and Final Security Review (FSR) Process** 

This class covers the end-to-end SDL process, but most important, it prepares development groups for the
final security review, outlining what they can expect during an FSR. The target audience
is more senior employees because these folks need to build SDL time into their schedules.
A key facet of the class is explaining the importance of building time into the schedule
for all the SDL requirements.



**Security Tools Overview** 

There are many security tools available inside and outside
Microsoft. This class covers some of the most important tools for performing code analysis,
design analysis, attack surface reviews, penetration testing, threat modeling, and
fuzz testing.



**Performing Security Code Reviews Very** 

few people know how to review code correctly for security bugs. This class teaches some of the critical skills, such as understanding
lack of trustworthiness of most incoming data, as well as ranking system entry points by
potential “attackability.” This in part is driven by the threat model, which identifies the
dangerous interfaces into the application.



**Secure Coding Practices**  

Going beyond “The Basics,” this class teaches developers how
to create secure software not simply by applying best practice, but also by using good,
sound security discipline and secure coding patterns.

Security Bugs in Detail This class covers a catalog of security bugs along with their
causes, mitigations, and defenses. The class then examines security bugs in more detail,
showing specific bugs in various software products.



**Attack Surface Analysis (ASA) and Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)** 

This class outlines what defines attack surface for common applications and platforms and how to drive
attack surface down while trying to keep the application useful for customers. 



**Exploit Development** 

This advanced class outlines how to create exploit code to take
advantage of vulnerabilities. Obviously, the purpose of the class is to educate, not to
attack real systems. When it comes to showing how dangerous security bugs can be,
there is nothing quite as effective as seeing an exploit in action.



**Build Requirements**

 The target audience for this class is people involved in creating the
daily build. Admittedly, most companies don’t need this class, but for companies like
Microsoft, it’s important because the build process must be protected, and the correct
security tools must be run on the build.



**Security Response** 

There will be security bugs in products, and it’s important that your
team understands what the security response is going to be. This subject is covered in
detail in Chapter 15, “Stage 10: Security Response Planning.”



**Cryptography by Example** 

This class takes a scenario of two people wishing to communicate
securely and builds up to a secure solution using cryptographic primitives to
mitigate real threats. The second part of the class covers cryptographic best practice.



**Customer Privacy** 

This online training class focuses on protecting customer data, most
notably protecting private user data maintained by some of the Microsoft online properties,
such as MSN (Microsoft 2006a). The basics taught include legal aspects of privacy,
privacy statements, the data lifecycle, and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), as
well as global privacy policy such as notice, choice, access, security, onward transfer,
data integrity, and enforcement.
